Wow, just what even was all that?! I stumble out of The Amateur and, man, it's like coming out of a dream where you know you were flying but forgot to flap. My back's aching — maybe it's that terrible theater seat or maybe it’s the weight of a thousand plot twists resting awkwardly across my shoulders. Seriously, should've stretched beforehand or something. Popcorn everywhere. In my shoe too, how does that even happen?

So yeah, the  ! This one scene keeps looping in my head, this guy – the main dude, can’t even remember his name, maybe Mike? – and he's just there, staring across a vast empty field like he's lost something important, like his keys. And then BAM, he just starts running. Just as I was about to comment on the sudden sprint, why does he remind me of my old cat, that one that used to bolt for no reason and slam into walls? Glitch in the Matrix, I swear.

>Doesn't help with a theater so loud I could barely separate dialogue from exploding popcorn kernels. Got to 𝘥𝘰𝘸𝘯𝘭𝘰𝘢𝘥 the   later, maybe 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩 when it's quiet, see if it makes more sense without the symphony of chomping echoing in my ears.

Oh, remember the scene with the mysterious phone call? It's totally stuck in my mind. So tense, like threading a needle while blindfolded on a tightrope above a pit of angry squirrels. Who was calling? What did it mean? Classic misdirect, but good nevertheless. The way it's shot, the contrast, light, shadows, really screams Hitchcock meets someone who lost the instruction manual on a new camera.

Then there was the old lady, nodding off in the row ahead of me — was she part of the 𝘧𝘪𝘭𝘮, or just getting some much-needed rest, dreaming maybe of starring opposite Clooney? I never quite figured, but I hope she found her plot.

At some point, I remember needing to use the bathroom but then got sucked back in by a dialogue so sharp it cut through my bladder's complaints like a knife made of sound waves. I'll need a 𝘥𝘰𝘸𝘯𝘭𝘰𝘢𝘥 to pause next time. Catch all the bits I missed, or those I just didn’t get from the start. Was it crystal clear storytelling or beautifully ambiguous confusion? You decide when you 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩 the  .

function amateurImpressions { let fascination = true; if (mind.blowing) { fascination = false; } // Note to self: This isn’t supposed to be here
  
Yeah, so, when you do go and 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩 it or whatever, bring a cushion.
